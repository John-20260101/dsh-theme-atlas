# Image sizes / 图片尺寸规范

Every image in this repository is generated, not hand-exported: `npm run shots` renders the static preview pages at the sizes below and writes them into `assets/`. That is why the table is a contract — a size changed in `scripts/shots.mjs` without changing this document is a bug.

仓库里所有图片都是生成的：`npm run shots` 按下列尺寸渲染静态预览页并写入 `assets/`。所以这张表就是契约——改了 `scripts/shots.mjs` 却没改这里，就是 bug。

| 2 | `assets/icon-512.png` | 512×512 | 1:1 | PNG | storefront / plugin-manager tile | this doc |
| 3 | `assets/icon-180.png` | 180×180 | 1:1 | PNG | small tile, list rows | this doc |
| 4 | `assets/screenshots/00-hero-2400x1350.jpg` | 2400×1350 | 16:9 | PNG | material contact sheet | README |
| 5 | `assets/screenshots/00b-leshan-2400x1350.jpg` | 2400×1350 | 16:9 | PNG | Leshan triptych banner, README social preview | README, `screenshots.json` |
| 6 | `assets/screenshots/01…06-*-1600x1000.jpg` | 1600×1000 | 16:10 | JPEG | one storefront screenshot per material skin (light) | `screenshots.json` (subset) |
| 7 | `assets/screenshots/07-aurora-dark-1600x1000.jpg` | 1600×1000 | 16:10 | PNG | dark-mode showcase | `screenshots.json` |
| 8 | `assets/screenshots/08-paper-dark-1600x1000.jpg` | 1600×1000 | 16:10 | PNG | high-contrast showcase | README |
| 9 | `assets/screenshots/09…11-*-1600x1000.jpg` | 1600×1000 | 16:10 | JPEG | Leshan skins, light appearance (photo + frosted plates) | `screenshots.json` |
| 10 | `assets/screenshots/12-sanjiang-dark-1600x1000.jpg` | 1600×1000 | 16:10 | PNG | Leshan dark showcase | `screenshots.json` |
| 11 | `assets/keyart/<skin>-1536x1024.jpg` | 1536×1024 | 3:2 | JPEG | key art per skin (material posters, photo-led for Leshan) | `docs/themes.md` |
| 12 | `assets/wallpapers/leshan-<id>-<w>x<h>.jpg` | native 1448×1086 / 1536×1024 | 4:3-ish | JPEG | the photographs the three Leshan skins use, served at native size and cover-cropped by the shell | runtime, docs |

`screenshots.json` lists eight images — the storefront maximum — chosen as: the Leshan banner, the three Leshan light shots, one Leshan dark shot, and three material shots (Ink Jade, Paper, Aurora dark). The remaining sixteen renders are documentation and stay out of the storefront list.

## 2. Why these numbers

- **Icon, 1024 master.** Marketplaces draw the tile at roughly 96 px. Exporting from a 1024 master keeps the geometry clean at any scale and lets the same file serve an App Store–style 512 and a 180 list row without resampling twice.
- **1600×1000, not 1920×1080.** DSH is a three-column desktop shell; 16:10 at 1600 wide is the smallest canvas where the sidebar, transcript and right panel all read without shrinking type below 11 px. It also halves cleanly to 800×500 in a detail modal.
- **2400×1350 for the banner.** 16:9 so it can be reused as a GitHub social preview without letterboxing; 2400 wide because the contact sheet carries six cards and the type has to survive being shown at ~900 px in a README.
- **1536×1024 for key art.** 3:2 prints and crops well, and matches the size the poster layout was composed for; downscaling to 1152×768 still keeps the microtype legible.
- **JPEG for renders, PNG for icons.** Renders are shipped as JPEG: quality 86 with 4:4:4 chroma for the UI shots (text stays crisp, hairlines do not smear), quality 84 4:2:0 for key art. The whole render set fell from ~18 MB of PNG to ~2.4 MB without a visible difference at 100%. Icons stay PNG — flat geometry, and they need the alpha.
- **Wallpapers at quality 78.** 1.4 MB of JPEG for the three photographs; they are viewed under a scrim, so the last few percent of quality is invisible while the bytes are not.
- **Wallpapers are not re-rendered.** They are the author's files, kept at native resolution; the filename carries their real pixel size so the asset test can verify them like any other image.

## 3. Display guidance

| Surface | Renders at | File to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dsh-market / plugin tile | ~96 px square | `icon-512.png` (never the 180) |
| Plugin detail screenshots | up to ~1200 px wide | the 1600×1000 shots |
| README banner | ~900 px wide | `00-hero-2400x1350.png` |
| Docs inline figure | 640–760 px wide | key art, or the 1600 shot scaled by CSS |
| Social preview | 1200×630 crop | hero, centre-cropped to 1.9:1 |

The 180 px icon exists for list rows and README badges; it is a downscale of the 1024 master, not a separately drawn mark.

## 4. Regenerating

```sh
npm run build      # palettes first: images are painted from derived tokens
npm run shots      # renders UI shots (dsf 2, saved at CSS size), key art, icon
```

- UI screenshots are captured with `deviceScaleFactor: 2` and saved with `scale: 'css'`, so the file is exactly 1600×1000 while the type was laid out with 2× rasterisation.
- Every render runs a geometry gate: if any element overflows the fixed canvas, the script prints the page and the offending nodes, so a 2400×1350 banner cannot silently start clipping its footer.
- The icon is rendered once at 1024 and cut to 512 / 180 with `sips`:

```sh
sips -z 512 512 assets/icon-1024.png --out assets/icon-512.png
sips -z 180 180 assets/icon-1024.png --out assets/icon-180.png
```

- Optional, not committed: a 1280×640 social card and a 2× (3200×2000) screenshot set. If a storefront asks for them, render at the same CSS layout and only change the export size.

## 5. Checklist before shipping an image change

1. `npm run verify` passes (the images must match a valid palette).
2. The file name still carries its pixel size — a mismatch between name and file is a documentation bug.
3. `screenshots.json` still lists exactly the UI shots, in reading order, and no key art.
4. The README and this table agree with the file listing:

```sh
ls assets/screenshots assets/keyart assets/wallpapers assets/*.png
```
